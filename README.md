# Housing-Affordability-and-Market-Trends-in-Malaysia

#### Problem Statement
Housing affordability is a growing concern in Malaysia, where rising property prices have outpaced income growth, making homeownership increasingly challenging for many individuals. This project aims to analyze housing market trends, identify affordability issues, and predict future price trends using machine learning techniques.

#### Executive Summary
This project explores housing affordability and market trends in Malaysia through data-driven analysis. By leveraging a real-world dataset, we apply exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models to uncover insights into property prices, affordability trends, and predictive modeling for future housing costs. We employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance, alongside various regression models for price prediction.

Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing housing prices, offering valuable insights for policymakers, investors, and prospective homebuyers. The project's outcome aims to assist in informed decision-making regarding real estate investments and housing affordability policies.
